### Let's create our first Jenkins job!

1. Open Jenkins in localhost and login
2. Create a new pipeline project (You can try the same with freestyle first)
3. Give GitHub URL as https://github.com/raghav710/sample-flaskql-calculator
4. Choose `Poll SCM` and duration as `*/1 * * * *` to poll every 1 minute
5. In Configure enter the following pipeline definition (replace `bat` with `sh` for linux)

NOTE: For git to work, you need to go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Tools and give the git path

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/raghav710/sample-flaskql-calculator'
            }
        }
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                bat 'pip install Flask pytest'
            }
        }
        stage('Build and Test') {
            steps {
                bat 'python -m pytest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now let's say we want to add an if condition into the above pipeline, we could use scripted pipelines to make our intent clearer

```
node {
  stage('Checkout Code') {
    git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/raghav710/sample-flaskql-calculator'
  }

  stage('Install Dependencies') {
    bat 'pip install Flask pytest'
  }

  stage('Build and Test') {
    bat 'python -m pytest'
  }

  if (currentBuild.currentResult == 'SUCCESS') {
        stage('Deploy') {
            bat 'echo SUCCESS!' 
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: The same can be done in declarative pipeline as seen in https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#pipeline-example but we give the above as an example to show how to use scripted pipeline.

We finally do an actual "deployment" by copying over the files to a target location

```
node {
  stage('Checkout Code') {
    git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/raghav710/sample-flaskql-calculator'
  }

  stage('Install Dependencies') {
    bat 'pip install Flask pytest'
  }

  stage('Build and Test') {
    bat 'python -m pytest'
  }

  if (currentBuild.currentResult == 'SUCCESS') {
        stage('Deploy') {
            fileOperations([
                     folderCopyOperation(sourceFolderPath:'.', destinationFolderPath:'C:/Users/Lenovo/prod/')
                ])
        }
    }
}
```

We can also write the above in a Jenkinsfile in the repository so we don't need to manually enter the pipeline script everytime.
